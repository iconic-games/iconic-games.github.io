							<h2>An AI First Games Studio</h2>
							<p>At Iconic we aim to embrace AI to enhance human creativity not replace it. We are a small studio with a big vision of delivering bigger and better games with unprecedented experiences that only AI can enable.</p>
							<p>So we have formed an elite team of veteran AAA game developers and AI/ML specialists to make this vision a reality.</p>

							<h2>Every Employee is an Owner</h2>
							<p>We believe in fairness and we believe in ownership. Every employee at Iconic has skin in the game and shares in the company. That way when we're successful everyone can share in the rewards.</p>
							<p>We also operate profit sharing schemes so everyone working on a game shares in those rewards on our collective journey.</p>
							<p>Iconic was founded with a firm belief that this is the right way to operate. Sadly, in our industry employees are so often mistreated and their passion for games taken advantage of while not being fairly rewarded for the amazing things they build. Iconic is different.</p>

							<h2>Londons Newest AAA Studio</h2>
							<p>In January 2024 we moved into our new London offices. We are a hybrid workplace and believe in flexibility, but we also understand that making games is a creative endeavour that involves many different talents working together on a single objective. And so we have made our offices a place where people will enjoy meeting with their colleagues and unleashing their creativity together</p>
							<p>As well as a place to work, our office has break-out spaces, all the latest consoles &amp; games and some retro ones too for research and fun and a fully stocked snack kitchen!</p>
