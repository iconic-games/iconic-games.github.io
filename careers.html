							<h2>An AI First Games Studio</h2>
							<p>At Iconic we aim to embrace AI to enhance human creativity not replace it. We're a small new studio and but we want to make a huge impact and deliver to our players bigger, better games and new types of experiences that were not previously possible.</p>
							<p>To achieve these goals we've formed an elite team of experienced AAA developers and experts in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

							<h2>Every Employee is an Owner</h2>
							<p>We believe in fairness and we believe in ownership. Every employee at Iconic participates in the equity programme and has skin in the game owning shares in the company. That way when we're successful everyone can share in the rewards.</p>
							<p>We also operate profit sharing schemes so everyone working on a game shares in those rewards on our journey too.</p>
							<p>Iconic was founded with a firm believe that this is the right way to operate. Sadly in our industry employees are so often mistreated, their passion for games taken advantage of while at the same time not being fairly rewarded for the amazing things they build. Iconic is different.</p>

							<h2>Londons Newest AAA Studio</h2>
							<p>In January 2024 we moved into our new London offices. We're a hybrid workplace and believe in flexibility but we also understand that making games is a creative endeavour that involves many different talents working together on a single objective. We've made our offices a place where people enjoy meeting with their colleagues and unleashing their creativity together</p>
							<p>As well as a place to work our offices include break spaces, with all the latest consoles, games and some retro ones too for research purposes and a fully stocked snack kitchen!</p>
