						<h1>Iconic Founded</h1>
						<h2>Company incorporated</h2>
						<h3>24 March 2023</h3>
					</span>
					<div>
						<img src="images/careers-sq.png">
						<p>We had a vision for Iconic to build a new type of games studio leveraging AI to empower human creativity rather than replace it, forming a small but elite team of AAA games experience and AI expertise to deliver to players bigger, better games and experiences that previously wouldn't be possible.</p>
						<p>John and Junaid were out at GDC in San Francisco talking to the great and the good of the games industry and everyone was telling us don't even think about starting a new AAA studio, it's not possible, you'll need at least a hundred million dollars and AI isn't going to change anything. So of course we incorporated Iconic on the last day of the conference with the confidence that we're not going to see a lot of competition in this area and the firm belief that everything is going to change. We're going to be on the forefront of that change, providing better value and more variety for players and better working experience and real ownership for developers.</p>
